# Workshop: Introduction to Docker

## Installation

### Windows 10 Pro / Mac OS X / Linux ###
1. Visit [https://www.docker.com/community-edition#/download](https://www.docker.com/community-edition#/download) and download Docker for Mac or Windows.
2. Follow the instructions on the website to install Docker on your computer.
3. Start `Docker`

### Windows 10 Home ###
1. Visit [https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows) instead to download and install Docker Toolbox.
2. Ensure that you've verified your docker toolbox installation in step 3 on that page. The Docker CLI should be installed and accessible via Git Bash, and all console/terminal commands should be run Git Bash.

## Verify your docker installation

1. Open your `Console`.

2. Type: `docker -v`

	This should show you which version of Docker you have installed.

	This will be the primary way in which you will interact with your Docker environment.

3. Type: `docker info`

	This should show you a wall of text with info about your Docker daemon (or your Docker installation).
